# UI polish

> Exact values for the small details that make an interface feel finished. Ported from `jakubkrehel/skills` `better-ui` (MIT). Use the numbers written here.

When reviewing, slow the interface down. What feels off at 10% speed is what is subtly wrong at full speed.

Keep the project's component library, tokens, and density, and match its motion language except where a rule below prescribes an exact interaction.

Every duration, curve, scale, and blur below is a specific value, not a range to approximate. `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)` is not `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`, and `0.96` is not `0.95`. Use what is written.

Text wrapping, font rendering, tabular numbers, spacing, breakpoints, hit areas, focus, keyboard support, ARIA, and reduced motion belong to `vd:uiuxdesign`. Posting review comments on a pull request belongs to `vd:code-review`. This skill owns the polish values and the polish-pass report.

## Concentric border radius

Outer radius = inner radius + padding. Mismatched radii on nested elements is the most common thing that makes an interface feel off. Radius, shadow, and outline recipes are in [surfaces.md](references/surfaces.md).

## Optical over geometric alignment

When geometric centering looks off, align optically. Buttons with icons, play triangles, and asymmetric icons all need a manual nudge.

## Shadows for elevation, borders for structure

Where a border exists only to create depth, prefer layered transparent `box-shadow` values. Keep borders that communicate structure or state: dividers, separators, and selected or focus states.

## Interruptible animations

Use CSS transitions for interactive state changes, because they can be interrupted mid-animation. Reserve keyframes for staged sequences that run once.

## Split and stagger enter animations

For an infrequent staged entrance where sequence communicates hierarchy, break the content into semantic chunks and stagger them by ~100ms. Animating one container gets you less for the same cost. Leave high-frequency interactions unstaggered. See [enter-exit.md](references/enter-exit.md).

## Subtle exit animations

Use a small fixed `translateY` rather than full height. Exits should be softer than enters. Use `ease-out` for both directions.

## Contextual icon animations

Animate icons with `opacity`, `scale`, and `blur` rather than toggling visibility. Use exactly these values: scale `0.25` to `1`, opacity `0` to `1`, blur `4px` to `0px`.

With a motion library (`motion` or `framer-motion` in `package.json`), match that package's import path, or nearby imports where both exist. Use `transition: { type: "spring", duration: 0.3, bounce: 0 }`. Bounce is always `0`.

Without one, keep both icons in the DOM with one absolutely positioned, and cross-fade with `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)`. That gives you enter and exit with no dependency. Both recipes are in [icon-transitions.md](references/icon-transitions.md).

## Image outlines

Give images a `1px` outline at low opacity for consistent depth. Pure black in light mode (`oklch(0 0 0 / 0.1)`), pure white in dark (`oklch(1 0 0 / 0.1)`). Never a near-black like slate or zinc and never a tinted neutral. A tinted outline picks up the surface underneath and reads as dirt on the image edge.

## Scale on press

A `scale(0.96)` on click gives a button tactile feedback. Always `0.96`; anything below `0.95` feels exaggerated. Add a `static` prop to switch it off where motion would distract. See [recipes for CSS, Tailwind, and Motion](references/animations.md#scale-on-press).

## Skip animation on page load

Use `initial={false}` on `AnimatePresence` to keep enter animations off the first render. Check that it leaves intentional page entrances intact.

## Suppress transitions on theme switch

A theme flip changes color, background, border, and shadow on nearly every element at once. Every transition on those properties fires together and the switch smears instead of snapping. Inject `*,*::before,*::after{transition:none !important}`, force a reflow, then remove it on the next frame. Cover both the OS media query and the in-app class toggle. See the [recipe](references/animations.md#suppress-transitions-on-theme-switch).

## Transition only what changes

Always name the exact properties: `transition-property: scale, opacity`. Tailwind's `transition-transform` covers `transform, translate, scale, rotate`.

## Use `will-change` sparingly

Only for `transform`, `opacity`, and `filter`, which the GPU can composite. Never `will-change: all`. Add it when you see first-frame stutter, not before. See [performance.md](references/performance.md).

## Match icon stroke to text weight

An icon next to text carries the text's optical weight: `1.5px` stroke beside regular (400) text, `2px` beside semibold (600). One stroke weight per icon set and one icon library per surface. Sizing and RTL flipping are in [icons.md](references/icons.md).

## One SVG, recolored per state

Icons use `currentColor` and take hover, selected, and disabled states from CSS color and opacity, never from separate assets. Outline is the default variant; fill marks the active state.

## Motion restraint

Give high-frequency interactions instant feedback, or a transition of `150ms` or less on opacity and color. A custom animation there charges its attention cost on every trigger.

Every animated state change also needs a static cue: color, an icon, or a label. Motion is never the only feedback channel.

## Before you finish

| Mistake | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Icons look off-center | Nudge optically with padding, or fix the SVG |
| Jarring staged entrance or exit | Stagger infrequent entrances; keep exits subtle |
| Theme toggle crossfades the whole page | Disable transitions for the swap, force a reflow, restore on the next frame |
| `transition: all` on elements | Specify exact properties |
| First-frame animation stutter | Add `will-change: transform` (sparingly) |
| Hairline icon beside bold text | Match the stroke width to the text weight |

## Reporting

**Severity.** `HIGH` breaks an interaction, makes motion unusable, or leaves a state change visible only while the animation runs. `MEDIUM` is a visible inconsistency in surfaces, icons, or motion. `LOW` is isolated polish.

**Verification.** Without a browser: every state the component defines, meaning hover, focus, active, loading, and empty, plus motion durations and easings read from the code. With one: walk each state, and replay motion at 10% speed in the browser's Animations panel. Report every check you could not run as `Not verified`.

**Format.** Group findings under the principle each violates, ordered by severity, one row per root cause listing every location it appears in:

| Severity | Location | Before | After | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

`Location` is `path/to/file:line`. `Why` names the principle and the user impact.

End with `Block` when any `HIGH` remains, `Approve` otherwise, leaving the rest in the table as work to do. Never `Approve` coverage you did not inspect. With nothing to report, state "No actionable UI-polish findings" and report verification.
