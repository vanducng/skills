# Pick the chart: the view module

You do the work that needs judgment: the words on each state and arrow, the phases and their colors, the title, and the report to the reader. Put your work in a view module, and give it with `--view`.

To show the reader's words, the view exports `state(vars)`. The value that `state()` returns picks the form:

- A string gives a flat chart: `export const state = (v) => (v.paid ? "Paid" : "Paying");`
- An array gives parent states: `export const state = (v) => v.main.split(".");`
- An object gives one parallel region for each key: `export const state = (v) => ({ Playback: v.playback, Volume: v.volume });`

Label each state with what the reader can see or cares about, such as "Paying" or "Lease held, write pending". Keep variable names out of labels. In `vars`, a TLA+ sequence is an object with keys from 1, so `v.pc[1]` is `pc[1]`. A set is an array.

The view can also export `step(action, from, to)`. It gets the TLC action name and the values before and after the step, and it returns the label of the arrow. Write each step label as the user sees it happen, such as "you press play" or "the connect fails". Do not name the code or the TLA+ action. Two actions that end the same in the chart get the same label, so that they share one arrow.

When a step can occur only in some conditions, end its label with the condition in brackets, in the reader's words, such as `you press play [while the file loads]`. In a regions chart, the command writes the condition on the other regions on the arrow, in the words of their labels, such as `[when Offline]`. Your brackets replace it, and two arrows from one state can then look the same. So in a regions chart, do not write brackets for a condition on another region. When a value that no label shows decides where a step goes, name the result in the label, such as "the roster read fails".

The view can also export these:

- `group(vars)` returns the name of a phase. Each chart state gets the color of its group. When the model states behind one chart state are in different groups, that state gets no color.
- `colors` gives each group name a color class.
- `title` is a string that the chart shows at the top.

The command calls `state()` and `group()` at most once for each model state, and `step()` at most once for each step. The chart and the report both use those answers. So make each function depend only on its arguments.

The chart does not draw a step that stays in one label. Split a label when the reader must see such a step.

Aim for about 20 arrows or fewer, because a busier chart is hard to read. First return coarser labels from `state()`. Give one label to values that act the same, and leave out a detail that the reader does not need, such as a call in flight whose return changes nothing. Keep each state of a bug path, and keep each mark. When a merge changes a `breaks` state to `mayBreak`, it hides where a rule breaks. Do not merge two states that break different rules, because the reader then cannot see which rule breaks where. If the chart is still too busy, return `null` from `step()` for the steps that the reader does not need, such as a reset that every state has, or a step whose arrow repeats what other arrows show. Obey these rules when you hide steps:

- Keep each chart state reachable by arrows from a start state.
- Keep at least one arrow out of each chart state that has a step out in the model.
- Hide all the steps of an arrow, or none of them. When you hide only some, its condition gets narrower.
- In the hand-off, say which steps the chart hides.
